<br>
<br>
<br>
-------10. "PewDiePie": 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie"> Pewdiepie's Channel </a>
<br>
PewDiePie is the second most subscribed to youtuber in all of youtube with a whopping 107 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS. He creates videos such as him playing video games, Irl vids, reddit reactions, and try not to laughs. A very versatial youtuber who is very funny. And thats why I place him at number 10
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------9. "The Outer Middle Show": <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoAxtiY4NrFBMdsvYFI_B3A"> The Outer Middle Show Channel </a>
<br>
The Outer Middle Show, or also known as "Vlad" is a youtuber with 436 thousand subscribers. He makes gaming videos. Survival and crappy horror games are his forte! He's a really funny guy and edits his videos well. I also enjoy his videos because they are more on the longer side. Anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. He is my number 9 spot
